# The (unofficial) Hit List API

Access [The Hit List](http://www.karelia.com/products/the-hit-list/mac.html) data via Node.JS, CLI, or web app.

Not affiliated with The Hit List.

## Getting started

```bash
yarn
yarn run build
node ./dist/cli/index.js
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

You can run a basic CLI, too:

```bash
npm run run -- --folders
```

(or `node ./dist/cli/index.js --folders`)

## Notes

In retrospect, I think THL uses CoreData for its storage, so :D.
